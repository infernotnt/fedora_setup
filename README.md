# fedora_setup
-This was made using Fedora(v33).

-Run it on a completely fresh/new fedora install.

-Run "install_fedora_setup.sh" to install it on your local machine. The ONLY way to run it is "sudo ./install_fedora_setup.sh".

-If you later on change some of the settings on your machine and want those changes to be reflected on the automatic installer, run "update_backup_fedora_setup.sh". This will not change your local setup. It will only change the automatici installer.

-For a nice looking boot loader(a grub2 sekiro theme) do "git clone https://github.com/infernotnt/sekiro_grub_theme.git"
